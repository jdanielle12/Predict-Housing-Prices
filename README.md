## Overview
This project aims to analyze the Ames Housing dataset to predict house prices using various regression models and to forecast future trends using the Facebook Prophet model. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and time series forecasting.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Ames Housing dataset from Kaggle, which includes numeroud features describing houses in Ames, Iowa, along with their sale prices. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashanknecrothapa/ames-housing-dataset)

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* prophet

These libraries can be installed using pip. Ensure you have them installed before running the code.

## Data Preprocessing

### Loading the Data
The first step involves loading the dataset and examining its structure. This includes checking the data types of each column and displaying the first few rows of the dataset to get an initial understanding of the data.
